# Overview
Finding the most secure aircraft for a company's new aviation segment is the goal of this project. Identifying low-risk aircraft models, comprehending the relationship between aircraft age and safety, and looking into geographical factors affecting accident rates are the main objectives of the analysis. We offer practical insights to support the decision-making process for aircraft acquisition by evaluating these data points, ensuring the business chooses aircraft with the lowest possible risk in order to maximise profitability.

# Business Understanding
The company plans on joining the aviation sector as part of a portfolio diversification strategy, which can offer a number of advantages like lower risk, exposure to fresh prospects, defence against market volatility, and more consistent returns. This study is essential to identify which aircraft pose the least risk because the organisation does not have extensive knowledge about aviation hazards. This will help them make well-informed purchasing decisions that will reduce costs and improve operational safety.

The main questions that drive this investigation are:

1.Which major variables affect the danger associated with flying?
2.According to past evidence, which aircraft are the least risky?
3.How do we formulate recommendations for aircraft purchase based on data?
