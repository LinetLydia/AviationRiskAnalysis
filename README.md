# Introduction
In today's competitive and highly regulated aviation industry, ensuring the safety of aircraft is crucial for profitability and operational success. As the company ventures into the aviation sector, understanding which aircraft models presents the lowest risks becomes a key strategic priority. This analysis aims to provide insights  into identifying low risk aircraft models, uncovering low factors such as aircraft age and geographical location influence accident rates. By leveraging historical data on civil aircraft incidents, this project offers data driven recommendations that will guide the company in making informed and secure aircraft acquisition decisions.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to determine the safest aircraft for a company's new aviation division. The analysis focuses on identifying low risk aircraft models, understanding the relationship between aircraft age and safety and exploring geographical factors influencing accident rates. By evaluating these key-factors, actionable insights are provided to support the decision making process for aircraft acquisitions, helping the company select aircraft that minimize risk and maximize profitability.

# Business Understanding
The company plans on joining the aviation sector as part of a portfolio diversification strategy, which can offer a number of advantages like lower risk, exposure to fresh prospects, defence against market volatility, and more consistent returns. This study is essential to identify which aircraft pose the least risk because the organisation does not have extensive knowledge about aviation hazards. This will help them make well-informed purchasing decisions that will reduce costs and improve operational safety.

The main questions that drive this investigation are:

1.Which major variables affect the danger associated with flying?
2.According to past evidence, which aircraft are the least risky?
3.How do we formulate recommendations for aircraft purchase based on data?

# Data Understanding and Analysis
Data Source: The National Transportation Safety Board provided the information, which covers civil aircraft accidents from 1962 to 2023 and includes international incidents.

Description of the Data: The AviationData.csv file, which includes important information such aircraft models, incident types, locations, and safety records, was chosen due to its high quality. In order to learn more about low-risk aircraft and the variables impacting accident rates, techniques for data cleaning and analysis were used, such as handling missing information and identifying outliers.

# Conclusion

Finding low-risk aircraft models is essential for reducing financial losses and guaranteeing operational safety, according to the analysis's findings. The main conclusions are as follows:

1.Identified Low-risk Aircraft Models: Certain aircraft models were shown to have continuously lower incident rates, which made them the best choices for purchase.
  
2.Relationship Between Risk and Aircraft Age: Given that the incident rate for older aircraft is often greater, newer ones might be less risky.
  
3.Geographic Impact on Incident Rates: Since accident rates differ depending on the area, geographical variables need to be taken into account when evaluating aircraft risk.
